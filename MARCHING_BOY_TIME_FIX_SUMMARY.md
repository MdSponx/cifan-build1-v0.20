# Marching Boy Time Display Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The "Marching boy" film was showing at 14:00 in the festival schedule instead of the correct time of 20:00 stored in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the time field priority logic in `src/hooks/useScheduleData.ts`. The code was not properly prioritizing dedicated time fields (`startTime1`, `startTime2`) over time extraction from screening date fields (`screeningDate1`, `screeningDate2`).

### The Problem
1. Films have both `screeningDate1/screeningDate2` fields (which contain full datetime) and dedicated `startTime1/startTime2` fields (which contain just the time)
2. The original logic was checking if `startTimeField` exists but not properly validating it before using it
3. When `startTimeField` was empty, null, or invalid, it would fall back to extracting time from the screening date
4. This caused timezone issues or incorrect time extraction from the date fields

## Fix Implementation

### Root Cause Identified
After analyzing the actual database structure, I found that the issue was caused by multiple places in the codebase where `timeEstimate: "‡∏ö‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢"` (Thai word for "afternoon") was being converted to `14:00` and overriding the correct `startTime1: "20:00"` field.

### Key Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Time Field Validation**: Added proper null/undefined checks before validating time format in `useScheduleData.ts`
2. **Improved Priority Logic**: Ensured dedicated time fields are always prioritized when they exist and are valid
3. **Removed timeEstimate Usage**: Completely removed `timeEstimate` field usage from all time calculation logic
4. **Fixed Service Layer**: Updated `featureFilmService.ts` to use `startTime1` instead of `timeEstimate` for screening times
5. **Fixed Utility Functions**: Updated `timeCalculations.ts` to ignore `timeEstimate` parameter completely

### Specific Code Changes

#### 1. In `src/hooks/useScheduleData.ts`:
**Before:**
```typescript
if (isValidTimeFormat(startTimeField)) {
  // Use dedicated time field
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (startTimeField && isValidTimeFormat(startTimeField)) {
  // Use dedicated time field - now properly checks for existence first
}
```

#### 2. In `src/services/featureFilmService.ts`:
**Before:**
```typescript
screenings: legacyData.screeningDate1 ? [{
  date: new Date(legacyData.screeningDate1),
  time: legacyData.timeEstimate || '', // ‚ùå This was the problem!
  venue: legacyData.theatre || 'TBD'
}] : undefined,
```

**After:**
```typescript
screenings: legacyData.screeningDate1 ? [{
  date: new Date(legacyData.screeningDate1),
  time: legacyData.startTime1 || '', // ‚úÖ Now uses correct field
  venue: legacyData.theatre || 'TBD'
}] : undefined,
```

#### 3. In `src/utils/timeCalculations.ts`:
**Before:**
```typescript
if (screeningDate1 || timeEstimate) {
  const startTime1 = screeningDate1 
    ? extractTimeFromScreeningDate(screeningDate1)
    : mapTimeEstimate(timeEstimate || ''); // ‚ùå This was causing the issue
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (screeningDate1) {
  const startTime1 = extractTimeFromScreeningDate(screeningDate1); // ‚úÖ Only uses screening date
  // üö® CRITICAL FIX: Completely ignore timeEstimate parameter
```

### The Fix Logic
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Use dedicated `startTime1`/`startTime2` fields if they exist and are valid time formats (HH:MM)
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Only fall back to extracting time from `screeningDate1`/`screeningDate2` if dedicated fields are missing or invalid
3. **COMPLETELY IGNORE**: The `timeEstimate` field is now completely ignored in all time calculations
4. **Enhanced Validation**: Check for both existence (`startTimeField`) and validity (`isValidTimeFormat()`) before using dedicated time fields

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Films with valid `startTime1`/`startTime2` fields will use those times directly (like "Marching boy" with `startTime1: "20:00"`)
- Films without dedicated time fields will fall back to date extraction
- The `timeEstimate: "‡∏ö‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢"` field will be completely ignored and won't interfere with time display
- "Marching boy" should now show at 20:00 instead of 14:00
- All other films should maintain their correct times

## Testing Recommendations
1. Check the festival schedule for "Marching boy" - it should now show 20:00
2. Verify other films still show correct times
3. Monitor console logs for time field processing to ensure proper priority logic
4. Verify that no films are showing Thai time words (‡πÄ‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≤, ‡∏ö‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢, ‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏≥, ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏∑‡∏ô) in the schedule

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useScheduleData.ts` - Fixed time field priority logic and enhanced validation
- `src/services/featureFilmService.ts` - Changed from using `timeEstimate` to `startTime1` for screening times
- `src/utils/timeCalculations.ts` - Removed `timeEstimate` fallback logic completely

## Debug Files Created
- `debug-marching-boy-time.js` - Debug script to analyze film time data
- `debug-marching-boy-time.cjs` - CommonJS version of debug script

## Impact
This comprehensive fix ensures that:
1. Dedicated time fields (`startTime1`, `startTime2`) are properly prioritized over all other time sources
2. The problematic `timeEstimate` field can no longer interfere with time display
3. The time display discrepancy for "Marching boy" and similar films is resolved
4. The system is more robust against future time-related issues
